Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973-1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geolog ists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981 - 1 037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, w hich provided an essential foundation for the later evelopment of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031 - 1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundred s of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.
